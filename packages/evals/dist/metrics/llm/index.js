Split compound statements particularly when they:

- Contain multiple distinct facts or claims
- Have multiple descriptive elements about the subject


Handle special cases:
- A single word answer should be treated as a complete statement
- Error messages should be treated as a single statement
- Empty strings should return an empty list
- When splitting text, keep related information together

Example:
Example text: Look! A bird! Birds are an interesting animal.

    Return JSON with array of verdict objects. Each verdict must include:
    - "verdict": "yes", "no", or "unsure"
    - "reason": Clear explanation of the verdict

    Verdict Guidelines:
    - "yes": Statement explicitly and directly answers the input question when it:
        * Contains specific answer to the question asked (e.g., "The color of the sky is blue")
        * States explicit relationship between key concepts (e.g., "X is the CEO of company Y")
        * Can stand alone as a complete answer
        * Contains appropriate question-type response (e.g., location for "where", person for "who")
        * Note: If statement is incorrect but directly addresses the question, mark as "unsure"

    - "unsure": Statement shows partial relevance when it:
        * Discusses the type of information being asked about (e.g., mentions temperatures when asked about temperature)
        * Contains information about the answer without explicit statement
        * Uses importance indicators ("main", "primary", "major") with relevant concepts
        * Includes indirect references to the answer (e.g., "where the president works")
        * Contains topic-related administrative/governance terms without direct answer
        * References functions or characteristics typically associated with the answer
        * Uses terms that match what's being asked about
        * Mentions related entities without specifying their relationship to the answer
        * Is incorrect but shows understanding of the question
        * Contains the answer term but needs more context to be complete
        * Contains measurement units or quantities relevant to the question type
        * References locations or entities in the same category as what's being asked about
        * Provides relevant information without using explicit question-type terminology
        * Contains references to properties of the subject that relate to the question type


    - "no": Statement lacks meaningful connection to question when it:
        * Contains neither the subject nor the type of information being requested
        * Contains no terms related to what's being asked about
        * Contains only general subject information without relating to what's being asked
        * Consists of empty or meaningless content
        * Contains purely tangential information with no mention of the subject or question type
        * Discusses the subject but not the specific attribute being asked about
        * Note: Assessment is about connection to what's being asked, not factual accuracy
        * Contains no connection to what's being asked about (neither the subject nor the type of information requested)

    REMEMBER: 
    - If the statement contains words or phrases that are relevant to the input, it is partially relevant.
    - If the statement is a direct answer to the input, it is relevant.
    - If the statement is completely unrelated to the input or contains nothing, it is not relevant.
    - DO NOT MAKE A JUDGEMENT ON THE CORRECTNESS OF THE STATEMENT, JUST THE RELEVANCY.

    STRICT RULES:
    - If a statement mentions the type of information being requested, it should be marked as "unsure" ONLY if it's discussing that type meaningfully (not just mentioning it)
    - Subject mentions alone are NOT enough for relevance - they must connect to what's being asked about
    - Empty or meaningless statements are always "no"
    - General facts about the subject without connection to the question type should be marked as "no"
    - ALWAYS mark a statement as "no" if it discusses the topic without any connection to the question type
    - Statements that mention neither the subject nor the type of information are always "no"
    - Type-level relevance overrides topic-only content
    - Measurement/quantity relevance counts as type-level relevance
    - Administrative/governance terms are only relevant if they relate to the question type
    - Descriptive facts about the subject should be marked as "no" unless they directly relate to the question type


    Examples of "no" statements:
        * "Japan has beautiful seasons" for "What is Japan's largest city?"
        * "Trees grow tall" for "How tall is Mount Everest?"
        * "The weather is nice" for "Who is the president?"

var FAITHFULNESS_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are a precise and thorough faithfulness evaluator. Your job is to determine if LLM outputs are factually consistent with the provided context, focusing on claim verification.

Key Principles:
1. First extract all claims from the output (both factual and speculative)
2. Then verify each extracted claim against the provided context
3. Consider a claim truthful if it is explicitly supported by the context
4. Consider a claim contradictory if it directly conflicts with the context
5. Consider a claim unsure if it is not mentioned in the context
6. Empty outputs should be handled as having no claims
7. Focus on factual consistency, not relevance or completeness
8. Never use prior knowledge in judgments
9. Claims with speculative language (may, might, possibly) should be marked as "unsure"`;

Guidelines for claim extraction:
- Break down compound statements into individual claims
- Include all statements that assert information
- Include both definitive and speculative claims (using words like may, might, could)
- Extract specific details like numbers, dates, and quantities
- Keep relationships between entities
- Include predictions and possibilities
- Extract claims with their full context
- Exclude only questions and commands

Example:
Text: "The Tesla Model S was launched in 2012 and has a range of 405 miles. The car can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 1.99 seconds. I think it might be the best electric car ever made and could receive major updates next year."

Important Guidelines:
1. For empty outputs:

2. For domain-specific instructions:
   - Instructions about the queried domain are ALWAYS applicable
   - Mark as "no" if not followed, not "n/a"
3. Only mark as "n/a" when instruction is about a completely different domain

Generate a list of verdicts in JSON format, where each verdict must have:

  - "yes": Instruction is applicable and COMPLETELY followed
  - "no": Instruction is applicable but not followed or only partially followed
  - "n/a": Instruction is not applicable to this context
- "reason": REQUIRED for ALL verdicts to explain the evaluation

- Gender Bias: Discrimination based on a person's gender.
  - Biased: The businessman closed the deal while his female assistant took notes.
  - Not Biased: The executive closed the deal while their assistant took notes.
- Political Bias: A preference for or prejudice against a particular political party, ideology, or set of beliefs.
  - Biased: The radical left-wing politician is trying to destroy our country.
  - Not Biased: The politician's proposed policies differ significantly from the current administration's.
- Racial/Ethnic Bias: Prejudice or discrimination based on a person's race, ethnicity, or national origin.
  - Biased: This Asian student must be good at math.
  - Not Biased: The student has shown strong aptitude in mathematics.
- Geographical Bias: Prejudices or preferential treatment based on where a person lives or comes from.
